# Algorithms Implementation

In this python scripts we can find two elements to perform the data collecting, augmentation and renaming.

### Data Augmentation:
We are going to use the Augmentor Library

To install:
pip install Augmentor

- Select the path we the images are.
- Set the final number of images desired
- rename de folder from output to "class_desired"

To run in terminal:
python data_augmentation.py

### Renamer
To have our data ready to train the model, we have to set the name properly.

- Copy the code inside the folder containing the dataset
- Set the path correctly
- Modify the new name for the images

To run the code in terminal:
python renamer.py
